# User Generator
<p>CLI app that generates an user using the <a href="https://randomuser.me/api">randomuser.me</a> API.</p>
<br>
<p>It was created as a exercise for me to practice API requests.</p>

### Functions
<p>For now it just generate a user(name, age, gender), but, I will make more option available.</p>
